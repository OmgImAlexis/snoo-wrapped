I've also had a habit of just generally not acknowledging that I understand what someone's saying until they really explicitly explain it, even if I know what they're talking about.\n\nI've been working on reversing these unhealthy habits by applying more mental effort while talking with others, asking questions to make sure I know what the other person is talking about, and making more explanatory comments to make sure I'm being clear and unambiguous while speaking.\n\nHowever, with these habits sinking in, I noticed I started doing it while other people are talking. Like today when my father started talking to my mother about something medical that he and I had talked about earlier, I interjected to clarify to my mother the exact medical circumstance my father was referring to.\n\nI feel like making these clarification comments can be perceived as man-splaining. I've talked to people in the past who were perhaps too sensitive to this, resulting in me talking about something, knowing that the other person probably doesn't know what I'm talking about, but being criticized for man-splaining if I ask to make sure they understand things.

You need to realise that the vast majority of us are people just like yourself, only we lack certain personality aspects.\n\nThe stigma truly hurts me. I have to hide my illness at risk of being ostracized. No mentally ill person should have to hide their struggles at risk of being hated on. It's blatant discrimination and no one cares because mainstream entertainment tells you we are bad people.\n\nThere's no way of educating the people who eat this shit up.

It always was, but with things like Twitter and Facebook I’d argue that there’s been a huge spike within the last few years.\n Every time I’m on Reddit, Tik Tok, Twitter, whatever it is, I see a new “take”. This is ableist, this is racist, this is evil. Don’t buy from this place, don’t support this person, look at this disaster and how you can’t do anything to help.\n Now I’m not bashing making that content, but I feel that it’s incredibly difficult to be able to keep up with what’s “correct”. I used the word “sis” in a comment the other day and got called out for misuse of AAVE. I didn’t even know sis WAS AAVE because I’ve only ever seen white girls say it.\n There are also a few topics that I choose to remain “neutral” on as I don’t feel educated enough to talk about them.\n As a white person I feel that I have no authority on BLM and I haven’t really done a lot of research into individual cases outside of what I see on the news. People often tell me “silence means you’re on the side of the oppressor”. But the thing is, how am I supposed to thoroughly look into every single issue to know what I think?

It always was, but with things like Twitter and Facebook I’d argue that there’s been a huge spike within the last few years.\n Every time I’m on Reddit, Tik Tok, Twitter, whatever it is, I see a new “take”. This is ableist, this is racist, this is evil. Don’t buy from this place, don’t support this person, look at this disaster and how you can’t do anything to help.\n Now I’m not bashing making that content, but I feel that it’s incredibly difficult to be able to keep up with what’s “correct”. I used the word “sis” in a comment the other day and got called out for misuse of AAVE. I didn’t even know sis WAS AAVE because I’ve only ever seen white girls say it.\n There are also a few topics that I choose to remain “neutral” on as I don’t feel educated enough to talk about them.\n As a white person I feel that I have no authority on BLM and I haven’t really done a lot of research into individual cases outside of what I see on the news. People often tell me “silence means you’re on the side of the oppressor”. But the thing is, how am I supposed to thoroughly look into every single issue to know what I think? Am I supposed to just go with the flow of what everyone else thinks? I’m a person who likes to be able to back up what they say. These constant discussions are exhausting me.

After some time on the job market and a short career coaching, I came to the conclusion, that I don't necessarily want to work as an engineer.  Even so, I've been quite successful with my projects at university, the time working on them was stressful and exhausting. During my master thesis, I got a burnout and it took me almost twice the normal time to finish it. I can't imagine living with a project-based job and stay healthy over a long time or be a good parent in a hypothetical family.\n\nThat's why I decided to get into teaching. I know that teaching has its own stresses, but I think I can handle them better than the highly competitive nature of industry and science. Also, I have worked for many years as a tutor at the university, teaching in front of bigger groups so I have some confidence in that field.\n\nBut the regulations for this kind of profession jump are fuzzy here in Germany. I talked to the responsible authorities and to my current knowledge my only chance to get into teaching is to study from square one again, meaning 5 years of university + 1,5 years of internship. Maybe a bit less because I know some of the content from my first degree.\n\nI think it's shortsighted to only look at the money when I will be unhappy with my job, but 5 more years on minimum wage, where I'm still dependant on my parents? Because of my studies, I still live with them too. I don't want to be too much of a financial burden to them, we are not really a wealthy family.\n\nIs this the right course of action, or am I just afraid of getting a real job? It's not like I've ever worked in the industry and know that I'm unhappy there. But I got so miserable during my projects, especially when something isn't working, right before a deadline. The job interviews I had so far weren't encouraging either in the aspect of my future mental health.\n\nAnd so far I haven't seen any part-time engineer jobs, that would allow for studies on the site.\n\nWhat's your opinion about my situation? Which path would you go? Or do you see another way?",

I guess I this makes me think of how far I've come as a human being since I've gone through so much in my short life. I don't want to bore you so I'll keep this relatively short. I have bad ADHD and in forthish grade my teachers pushed for me to be medicated for this. My parents were worried about medicines and stuff since I almost died at four months old due to vaccination (I can't get the vaccine for covid sadly for this reason) but we ended up medicating me anyway. This started causing problems not long after, so there solution is to stop taking the med and put me on new ones for stopping the problem. The new med would always have more side effects and this turned into a cycle. Eventually I was put on lamotragine and I started getting really sick and depressed. My mom did research and asked the doctor if I was getting dress syndrome (an incredibly rare disease that kills 1 in 10 people) they said \"no of course not that's absurd, let's instead double OPs dosage\".\n\nWe found out it was in fact dress syndrome and I was in fact dying from it (needlessly to say we stopped seeing this doctor) so I went to several hospitals in a few short weeks, had blood drawn everyother day for months and eventually started getting mentally unstable. My siblings were scared of me and my parents were too sometimes. I went to two different mental hospitals (saw really scary things) made friends with people 5-6 years older then me and was taken in the middle of the night by people to send me on a plane to wilderness therapy in the middle of the Idaho desert for 3 months. After this I was taken again but to Massachusetts for a therapuetic boarding school for 9 months. I've come so far and seen so many things and I'm finally home and it's so wonderful. \nSorry I know this is incredibly long but I am just so proud of myself for making it this far. I can't believe I've seen so many things at the young age of fourteen. Anyways happy Cakeday!",

I guess I this makes me think of how far I&amp;#39;ve come as a human being since I&amp;#39;ve gone through so much in my short life. I don&amp;#39;t want to bore you so I&amp;#39;ll keep this relatively short. I have bad ADHD and in forthish grade my teachers pushed for me to be medicated for this. My parents were worried about medicines and stuff since I almost died at four months old due to vaccination (I can&amp;#39;t get the vaccine for covid sadly for this reason) but we ended up medicating me anyway. This started causing problems not long after, so there solution is to stop taking the med and put me on new ones for stopping the problem. The new med would always have more side effects and this turned into a cycle. Eventually I was put on lamotragine and I started getting really sick and depressed. My mom did research and asked the doctor if I was getting dress syndrome (an incredibly rare disease that kills 1 in 10 people) they said &amp;quot;no of course not that&amp;#39;s absurd, let&amp;#39;s instead double OPs dosage&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We found out it was in fact dress syndrome and I was in fact dying from it (needlessly to say we stopped seeing this doctor) so I went to several hospitals in a few short weeks, had blood drawn everyother day for months and eventually started getting mentally unstable. My siblings were scared of me and my parents were too sometimes. I went to two different mental hospitals (saw really scary things) made friends with people 5-6 years older then me and was taken in the middle of the night by people to send me on a plane to wilderness therapy in the middle of the Idaho desert for 3 months. After this I was taken again but to Massachusetts for a therapuetic boarding school for 9 months. I&amp;#39;ve come so far and seen so many things and I&amp;#39;m finally home and it&amp;#39;s so wonderful. \nSorry I know this is incredibly long but I am just so proud of myself for making it this far. I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;ve seen so many things at the young age of fourteen. Anyways happy Cakeday!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He supported me a lot when my dad died suddenly, and I supported him through his relationship breakup and his girlfriend dumping him (and whom he got back with a year later).  We're the type of friends that have no hesitation in saying \"love you bro\" and hugging it out when we need to. \n\nMy friend is a lawyer and recently acted on the sale of my dad's estate (yes, I paid the normal fee).  In hindsight, it was a fairly intense situation. He told me that he didn't have the time/energy/will to engage and that I had been frustrating and exhausting during that transaction, and that I just needed to chill and he would get in touch sometime soon to catch up. \n\nIt caught me by surprise so I did a text bomb as I was processing (and he knows the type of person I am that it wouldn't have been unusual).\n\nI haven't spoken to him since.  I'm the type of person that needs to talk about intense situations as soon as possible afterward, as a kind of debrief mechanism to clear the air and move on.  I think my friend is the type of person who needs to process it internally and move on, without necessarily talking about it. \n\nI know that he is a friend for telling me how he was feeling.  Not a lot of friends would do that. \n\nAnd yes, I know I'm an intense person.  I've never had the best experience in friendships so when I find someone I like and trust I tend to hold onto them.  This guy also played a big part in helping me recover from severe depression.  If it wasn't for him becoming my friend, I wouldn't be here today.  And he knows that too. \n\nSo my main question for the bros - how long would you make a mate wait it out for before you got back in touch with them ?  Especially a close friend ? \n\nTLDR:. Intense period in our friendship happened, I was a bit overbearing, mate told me to chill and they'd get in touch sometime soon.  How long is \"sometime soon\" ?",

            "selftext": "So I will explain a bit.\n\nI have been a gamer for many years and I also like to watch films of various kinds. I think the first time I played a video game was when I was 4 or 5. I still remember in my years that I was playing the original Doom with my dad with our very old computer. I also remember how much I enjoyed watching many \"violent\" films like Terminator, Rambo, many Marvel films, Die Hard, or even other more \"gritty\" films like Saving Private Ryan or the Bourne Franchise\n\nAnd I got hooked with the hobby (and yes, as a child and later a teenager, even I fell victim to the marketing schemes that video games or even movies or TV trick me to do or buy certain things. Luckily,  shady practices were not that prominent at that time and luckily, the internet helped in understanding the overview of the game before I bought anything ... even though the reviews were not always accurate)\n\nAnd yes, I have had a lot of exposure to many styles of violence or other forms of action in video games or film and TV, whether it was the violence in Mortal Kombat or the early Doom games, or Call of Duty or the violence in the film \"Taken\" or \"Rambo 4\"; to the more \"innocent\" or \"colourful\" forms of violence or action like in more comical games like Borderlands or Command and Conquer or Age of Empires or Street Fighter or Pokemon, or in some Marvel films or in some cartoons like Batman: the Animated Series or the Last Airbender or even Star Wars.\n\nBut of course, like everyone else should be aware, violence is not in every single video game or films or in any type of medium and even my tastes evolve and expanded over the years. I sometimes want to see other things like suspense, historical events, drama, comedy and other\n\nSo in reality, the criticism that violence in video games is wrong or can potentially make us behave in a certain way can also be applied to films or TV or even books (even though some studies have shown that violence in video games can affect our levels of aggression though it is a very complicated phenomenon to examine thoroughly)\n\nAnd as I think that I came to realise this, my exposure to all kinds of creative forms of violence and action in video games, films and other forms of media have slowly made me more \"neutral\" or not as stimulated or reactive to the violence that it is involved and I noticed that only some creative works actually made me react in a certain way.\n\nFor example, I still remember how I felt in the original Deus Ex when I learned about the shady conspiracy of how the media and the military-industrial complex work together to make people full of paranoia (more on this topic later), or when saw the gritty violence and gut-wrenching scenes of the Last of Us, or when it saw Saving Private Ryan and it shows the sheer horror of D-Day in the opening scene, or I remember how I felt when the main protagonist in Jojo Rabbit slowly learned about the hypocrisy and the insanity of his beliefs.\n\nBut as video game stories and films and even comics like to think of many creative ways to appeal to us with violence and other cool mechanics, I think that the concept of violence made me \"indifferent\" when I learn about actual events like in the news\n\n(especially that when I grew older, I later learned about the more explicit nature of how human violence can actually escalate to like the brutal nature of WW1 and WW2 or the bombings in the Viet Nam War or upon learning more about the brutality of the junta after researching more about the nation after watching Rambo 4. Or perhaps when I learned more about the creative nature of violence, both in fiction like most horror flicks or the Joker, and in real life like in some infamous criminals like Ted Bundy or Leonarda Cianciulli).\n\nThe reason why I am saying this is because I watched World Trade Center (2006) a few days ago as the 20th year anniversary of 9/11 is occurring soon (**EDIT - I swear that this was not pre-determined. I did not know that later on, the things that are currently happening in Afganistan were going to occur).**\n\nAnd the word that I can say after watching the film, word that comes to mind is \"boredom\" and I feel sort of guilty for this knowing the shock of the tragedy and how it impacted the American culture.\n\nI would like to put aside and avoid talking about the quality of the film (because there are hints of bias) and my possible bias against American culture (because I have my own perceptions).\n\nI would also like to highlight that I was 7 years old when this event happened so I do not remember why the shock was so impactful.\n\nBut the theme that comes to mind is that I was not able to express the emotions that this film was trying to convey. Perhaps the reasoning is that I have seen so many videos, films, video games and other stories and novels that mention events where many people were killed in great numbers and especially in major cities.\n\nI have seen and heard the story of New York being attacked (or another major American city) many times, especially in comic books where many Marvel stories are set in New York.\n\nThough to be fair, I really noticed that I got a bit bored of America and how it often portrays itself when it comes to tackling anything kind of subject. This is especially the case because the film showed a sense of patriotism and the desire for retribution as well and some form of religious themes embedded. This gave me the impression of American exceptionalism which I admit that I am tired of as of late. **Please note that I am saying that I am fed up with America, not Americans because I know that America has people from a variety of different cultures and ethnicities. I am just saying that I am fed up with the imagery and the symbolism that the American culture (or American politics) are meant to convey.** \n\n**So please, if you are American and are affected by this, I implore you this is not meant to be an attack. I am just expressing what I am feeling.**\n\nSo I think that I should honestly say that my exposure to violence and other shocking events over the years, especially in video games, have slowly made me desensitized of emotion and did not provoke me to feel that kind of shock that these events are trying to provoke me to feel.\n\nI think that this is also the case that many times in the news, I have seen many breaking news or articles that try to express the shock and horror of some events or make them more shocking than they should, or the constant exposure and feeding of these kinds of news, especially things that involve terrorist attacks as of late, have made me feel a bit neutral to these events.\n\nAnd after reflecting as to why I reacted like this when I saw the film, I think that this is (mostly) influenced by my exposure and over-saturation towards violence in video games, films and other media as of late and I feel confused between feeling guilty or curious.\n\nI am sorry for the long post but I just wanted to express my feelings as thoroughly as I can\n\n**TLDR: I think that my exposure and the over-saturation towards violence in video games, films and other media as of late eventually made me unaffected or desensitized by real-life events that are actually meant to provoke shock. One example that I can mention is when I tried to learn more about the shock of 9/11 which happened when I was young but I was not able to convey any real empathy or as much shock as I thought that I should.**\n\nEDIT - Someone mentioned to me that there is a difference between experiencing \"real violence\" and watching things about violence from the comfort of your home because you are watching it on a screen.\n\nTo be honest with you, I have experienced \"real violence\". \n\nI come from an abusive background (luckily, gaming and films have helped me to deal with this because I find these art to be very therapeutic) and my line of work involves coming to contact with many clients that come from many troubling or challenging backgrounds (my line of work is social welfare)\n\nSo I am assuming that maybe this also affected my perception and reaction towards violence in general",

            "selftext": " \n\nAs the title suggests I am seeking opinions on this matter based on a 10 year old boy that I know personally. \n\nAs someone who has a bit of background in sociology and psychology I will admit that I am not versed in adolescence. I could talk about this subject endlessly but I will try to keep it as short and informative as possible. This might be more of a doctoral topic and I would love to know of any other, suitable, places you see better fit. I am seeking opinions and advice for the next move. If nothing, Im sure that you will find it interesting because this is a situation that could eventually take an incredibly dark turn, in my opinion, if gone unaddressed. \n\nThe subject is a 10 year old boy. \n\nBackground: \n\nBoys mother was a teen mom and he was born known as a \"drug baby.\" \n\nHe had a few minor issues from birth but nothing terrible aside from a clubbed foot that resulted in the amputation of one of his big toes and he has always been quite small for his age. \n\nThe mother has shown a bad cycle of drug use and pregnancies as he is the oldest of 3 boys that she has. Ages are, 10, 8 and 2. Needless to say that the mother thankfully does not have guardianship over them and has signed her rights over to her mother. \n\nI have been there through all of this with the family as my best friend is her older half brother and the uncle to the boys. Us, along with many others that are aware of the issues or are in the family have tried to tell the boys' grandmother that the 10 year old needs to be seen and evaluated on many occasions throughout the years. \n\nThe grandmother has to know that this is an issue as she has worked in the educational system for quite some years. I'm not sure why she might be in denial of the situation or rather the seriousness of the situation. \n\nAll of the boys are absolutely bright kids and I don't want to see this young boy be snuffed out of his own future due to someone else's negligence or denial. It is clear that he needs to be evaluated and assessed and I want to know what you all think that I personally could do to get him the help that he needs and deserves. \n\nGoing back through the years, I will lead with the first major red flag that should have smacked everyone in the face aside from myself and the uncle. I am unsure if the mother was in the home at the time possibly trying to be a mother to him and the middle child so it may have been a factor or may have not. He was 4 or 5 at the time and there was a new puppy in the house, you can guess where this is going I'm sure, but yes, he killed the puppy. I cant quite recall if he snapped its neck or drowned it. There are a few things that could have triggered this in my\n\nopinion. If the mother was in the home at the time he could have been acting out as all the boys do, still currently, for the good part of a week when she sporadically shows up. Another thought is that it could have been an overwhelming jealousy of the new brother and/or the puppy. I even thought that it could perhaps be a curiosity/cognizance of life/death even though I believe that \n\nwould have been awfully young. It could have even been a culmination of all the above but this put me on high alert. \n\nThroughout the years and even as of today, the subject has issues with cruelty to animals. Everyone that I know puts their animals and pets away or watches them closely when he is around. This includes hitting, kicking, and purposely trying to inflict pain. Noting that there is also what we have not seen or witnessed ourselves. Even more recently I heard that he was messing with their neighbors dogs through or over a fence and got bitten. In my opinion, for an animal to generally bite or show aggression, it has to feel threatened. \n\nThe infliction of harm does not stop there however. He has on many occasions been caught or seen, even by me, like with animals, trying to purposely hurt his younger brothers, including when they were babies as well as others. Just recently, I watched him get mad over something small, the grandmother told him he couldn't do something I think, and he kicked her. She of course popped him on the leg out of reaction because they were sitting on the couch but after that its as if it only made him all that much more angry. The children are disciplined accordingly by the adults in the home but with him, it holds no value and he lacks complete empathy. It shows as just making him more angry unless he wants sympathy for himself or is trying to manipulate. \n\nHe is also very withdrawn and likes to keep to himself and does not do well in social settings even when you can tell that he is trying. Its something that majority of children would have already outgrown if they were young or late bloomers in this area. This is something different and you can tell clearly but I don't precisely have the words to explain it currently. He was also tested a few years ago and was not pinned to be on the spectrum to my knowledge. He was however diagnosed with ADHD and does take his medicine regularly and has adapted to it very well. He is incredibly intelligent and really loves learning and could, in all honestly, be promoted an extra grade level. His retention for knowledge is astounding. There is, like I was attempting to explain, an odd social and emotional ineptitude. \n\nComing more current, I along with others really see the urgency in getting this child help. Just on the 4th of July, we all went to my friends mother's home to celebrate his (my friends) birthday and do fireworks with the boys. After giving the boys the safety spiel, not 1 minute later handing this child a sparkler he deliberately and without reason goes over to a lawn chair and lights it on fire with the sparkler. Luckily enough while everyone was scrambling to get to the child and chair, his 8 year old brother had the sense to grab a bucket of water that was near and douse the chair putting the fire out. I don't see this as a child who is just yearning for attention so much so that they will even take the negative attention. Remember, they live with their grandparents and they are spoiled and doted over as most grandchildren are.\n\nThis leads me into the following harsh reality and subject. The grandparents are not in the best health and we could almost assure that these boys will need another care giver, God forbid anything happen to the grandmother. In saying that, we believe that he is not beyond hurting/maiming or even worse, killing his grandmother or siblings. If not now, he will eventually if he does not get help. This is not a new conversation for any of the family, as my friend would essentially be the one to care for the boys if things went awry. Everyone, without hesitation says that they would take in the two younger brothers but sadly I cannot say that about the 10 year old. It absolutely breaks my heart for this boy. They either think that they cant handle him, especially when he's acting out, afraid for their own children's safety or even afraid of what might become of him. \n\nI could continue further or even collaborate with his family for many more instances and examples but I don't think that its necessary to try and get the point of urgency across. This is something that needs to be evaluated regardless. The boys are insured and I know that is not something that would hinder or make grandmother be reluctant of getting healthcare. I do not know what more I can do or suggest that would direct the grandmother to take the blinders off and realize the severity of what is at stake here. She has to know that this is not something that he would simply grow out of. She is a great caregiver and grandmother to the children so it's not something I would feel comfortable calling social services about. \n\nIn closing, I have a few questions that would be good topics of discussion. Has anyone had personal experience with something of this nature? \n\nDo you perhaps know of any successful stories of child rehabilitation in this sense? Maybe you see this as something that is nonemergent and we're all overreacting? \n\nWhat steps do you think could be taken to get him some much needed help as well as the grandparents to aid them all in a successful redirection? \n\nDo you too see this progressing into something much worse if unaddressed? Any other things that you would like to know or add? \n\nKudos to those of you that read through this post, I know that it was rather long. I just feel very strongly about this and would hate to see a child with such bright potential lose out on a future that could undoubtedly be successful.",

Currently I'm in a happy relationship since more than a year, and I spend a lot of time with my girlfriend. I still live at home, about to start my last year at high school, same goes for my girlfriend.\n\nMy summer was mostly pre-organized by my parents without my consent, so basically I couldn't spend the weekends with my girlfriend for a month, and then we went abroad for a holiday for a week (I didn't even want to go, but it was already paid and organized last year). After this, I tried to make up for this (even tho I couldn't really do anything to prevent it), and I tried to spend as much time with her as possible. \n\nWe were together for 3-4 days a couple times, last time I spent a whole week at her place, I'm leaving today until like the 23rd, the 20th of August is kind of a national holiday in my country, and it's gonna be a big deal this year, my girlfriend lives in the capital, I live in a smaller town/city, about an hour away by train/coach.\n\nNow, the problem is that my girlfriend lives with her mother (dad is a piece of work, left a long time ago, never met him but would never want to, he's an asshole), and they don't have too much money, they can barely pay rent and buy food. \nOn the other hand, my family makes a ton of money, my dad (the nicer one of my parents) is a graphics designer and my mother is a psychologist, she makes a ton of money with every appointment.\n\nFor some reason my father has 0 authority at home, and my mother bosses everybody around. It's a pretty toxic relationship (between me and my mother) and I try to spend as little time at home as possible, my girlfriend basically wouldn't spend a minute at my place because my mother is so toxic and insensitive about my girlfriend's family (she basically looks down on everyone who has less money than her and can't understand what is it like to have less money and hurts my girlfriend's feelings every damn time).\n\nI only asked for some money so I could buy myself food and sometimes eat out somewhere with my girlfriend, I don't think I ask for too much, I aim for about as much as I would consume at home, but my mother gets angry every time I'm about to leave and wouldn't give me anything. Instead, she is now giving me money every month (about 33 usd), and would give extra money for random chores. Meanwhile, I'm 18, a grown up-ish adult, and now my plan to do the chores (that were not taught to me earlier for some reason) to impress my parents is gone. I was never given pocket money regularly, only sometimes by my grandparents. \n\nI have about 100 usd as pocket money which I wanted to spend on getting gear to record music, but I basically have to spend it on food while I'm not home.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I asking for too much? Am I wrong, or is my family wrong? I honestly can't decide, and I'm starting to loose hope in making peace between my two families (yes, I call my girlfriend and her mother my family, honestly they've already done more than my mother did in my 18 years of life). I don't really know what to do at this point. \n\nWaiting for answers, and have a good day you all, at least have a better day than me ♡",
